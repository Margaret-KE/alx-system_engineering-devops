Postmortem: When Apache Had a Meltdown and Took Our App Down with It

Issue Summary:

Duration: February 17, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM (EAT)

Impact: Brace yourselves! Our beloved web app took an unexpected siesta for about 3 hours straight. Users were left scratching their heads as they encountered the dreaded 503 errors whenever they tried to access our app. It was like the app went on a coffee break without telling anyone!

Root Cause: Hold onto your hats! It turns out our trusty Apache server had a little too much to handle. A misconfiguration in its virtual hosts was like a sneaky gremlin, causing our server to throw in the towel and take a power nap.

Timeline:

10:00 AM: Uh-oh! Our monitoring tools went berserk, bombarding us with alerts screaming, "John, we have a problem!"
10:05 AM: The engineering team was summoned to the rescue. We geared up for battle against the impending chaos.
10:10 AM: Initial investigations felt like stumbling through a maze blindfolded. We chased ghosts in the network and poked the database, hoping for a clue.
10:30 AM: The database upgrade was fingered as the prime suspect. But alas, it was a red herring, leading us down a rabbit hole of confusion.
11:00 AM: With no end in sight, we called upon the wise old SysAdmin wizard to aid us in our hour of need.
11:30 AM: Gosh! After much head-scratching and beard-stroking, the culprit was unmasked - the misconfigured Apache virtual hosts!
12:00 PM: Armed with our newfound knowledge, we swooped in and applied a magical fix to tame the unruly virtual hosts.
1:00 PM: Victory! Our app emerged from its slumber, blinking in the bright light of a restored service.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: Picture this - our Apache server was like a hungry teenager at an all-you-can-eat buffet, spawning way too many worker processes thanks to those mischievous virtual hosts.
Resolution: We whipped those virtual hosts into shape, tweaking their configurations to play nice and avoid overloading our poor server.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Let's tighten the reins on our virtual hosts with some good old-fashioned documentation and best practices.
We'll put our virtual hosts through boot camp with automated testing to catch any shenanigans before they cause trouble.
Our monitoring systems are getting a makeover, with upgraded sensors to sniff out trouble before it snowballs into chaos.

Tasks:
Update our virtual host playbook with clear instructions and warnings against misconfigurations.
Conduct a thorough audit of all virtual hosts to weed out any troublemakers lurking in the shadows.
Enlist the help of automation tools to keep our virtual hosts in line and prevent future rebellions.

Conclusion:
Hold onto your hats, folks! With these measures in place, we're fortifying our defenses and ensuring that Apache's next meltdown remains nothing but a distant memory.
